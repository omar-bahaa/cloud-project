# cloud-project

Cloud deployment automation is a non-interactive system to install, customize and
manage Linux systems and software configurations on computers to build a scalable
cluster and small to large infrastructure.
Performing identical installations of an operating system and configuring it
over multiple machines is a monotonous task which surely will lead to errors over
time and it consumes a whole lot of time, and installation with manual interaction
is not scalable , but there is a way to save all that trouble by following the trend of
this era to automate the task, to automatically make nodes and add it to the cluster
unattended over fresh machines, and of course it is scalable.
Our project is to deploy a cloud over fresh machines which are the servers
on our main campus in E-JUST. The install clients will be installed via network, it
gets an IP address and boots a Linux kernel then the automatic installation is started
without interaction including the post installation scripts to configure the machines
to be nodes. It is a great advantage to build automatically as the same configuration
is done to all machines no issues will arise, also we can add classes to let certain
machines configured differently
